# Kirby Date Format

This plugin changes the format to `DD.MM.YYYY` for the `date field` and it's `structure field preview`.
With this example it should be easy to adapt the date format to your needs.

Just like the Kirby panel does, [Day.js](https://github.com/iamkun/dayjs) is used to work with date formats.
